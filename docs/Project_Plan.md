# Project Plan

## 1. Business Understanding

### Objective

The purpose of the project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast future stock prices of an index
based on historical data. This could aid in making informed investment decisions.

### Goals

The goals of the project are:

- Improving investment strategies
- Enhancing decision-making processes for buying and selling stocks.

These goals should align with the overall business objectives.

### Success Criteria

The criteria for success is achieving a prediction accuracy of at least 80%. This ensures that the model provides
actionable insights that can be utilized by traders and investors.

## 2. Data Understanding

### Data Collection

In this step, we will identify and gather historical stock price data from reliable financial data sources like Hugging
Face, Yahoo Finance or Bloomberg. We will ensure the dataset includes essential features such as open, close, high,
low prices, volume, and date.


### Dataset

The dataset chosen contains the daily stock prices of the S&P 500 index spanning from 1999 to 2024 per company, which is
a benchmark index that tracks the performance of 500 large-cap companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.
It's ideal to capture long-term trends and patterns.


### Data Exploration

We will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into data distribution and patterns.
Also, we will use visualizations to identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies in stock prices.

### Data Quality Assessment

We will evaluate the quality of the data by checking for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. We will assess
the completeness and relevance of the data to ensure it is suitable for modeling.

## 3. Data Preparation

### Data Cleaning

We will address missing values through imputation or removal and correct or remove outliers to ensure data integrity.

### Feature Engineering

We will aggregate the data from different companies to create a unified dataset for modeling.
Additionally, we will develop new features such as moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc., to enhance model performance.
Also, we will encode categorical variables if necessary to prepare the data for modeling.

### Data Transformation

We will normalize or standardize the data to improve model performance. Split the data into training, validation,
and test sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

## 4. Modeling

### Model Selection

We will evaluate different models, including multi-variate autore-gressive models like ARIMA as a baseline and others like Dynamic Regression, a hybrid 
with VAR and Multiple Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Machines, and  LSTM, to determine the most suitable approach for stock price prediction.

### Model Training

We will train each model using the training dataset and employ cross-validation techniques to fine-tune
hyperparameters for optimal performance.

### Model Evaluation

We will compare models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared. Select the best-performing model
based on these evaluation metrics.

## 5. Evaluation

### Model Validation

We will validate the selected model on the test dataset to ensure it meets the established success criteria and
performs well in real-world scenarios.

### Business Evaluation

We will assess the model's ability to provide actionable insights and conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine
its business value and impact.

## 6. Deployment

### Model Deployment

We will deploy the model in a production environment, setting up an API or dashboard for real-time predictions
to facilitate user access and interaction.

### Monitoring and Maintenance

We will continuously monitor model performance and update the model as new data becomes available. Implement a feedback
loop to ensure ongoing model improvement.

## 7. Documentation and Reporting

### Documentation

We will thoroughly document the entire process, including data sources, modeling techniques, and evaluation results,
to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

### Reporting

We will prepare a comprehensive report for stakeholders, including visualizations and insights derived from the model,
to communicate findings effectively.

## 8. Project Review

### Review and Reflection

We will conduct a project retrospective to identify lessons learned and discuss potential improvements for future
projects, ensuring continuous learning and development.
